# Qrypto-Escape
This Unity-based project introduces players to quantum cryptography concepts in an escape-room-style setting. Players interact with components on an optical table to simulate quantum measurements as part of the BB84 protocol, building a shared secret key to escape the room. This game was developed for QPoland's Quantum Hackathon 2024 and provides an immersive way to learn about quantum key distribution and quantum mechanics concepts. The idea came from laboratory demonstration of the BB84 protocol with optomechanical components from Thorlabs. We explored the idea of using a digital twin of the actual experimental photonics setup in an educational game. 
## Game Overview
In this escape room game, players embody Beatrice a quantum cryptographer. Beatrice wakes up, feeling dizzy, in a disorganized quantum cryptography lab. Something has gone wrong — the lab is in lockdown, and vital components needed for quantum communication are scattered. She receives a faint classical signal from her colleague Albert outside: “Beatrice, listen carefully. Eve is trying to intercept our data. You need to find the components, set up the optical table, and establish a secure quantum connection using the BB84 protocol before it’s too late. I’ll guide you, but we have to move fast.” Beatrice must now gather her wits, search for the missing optical components, and receive guidance from Albert through the classical channel to build the setup, perform the quantum key distribution protocol to receive a random key and then decrypt the encrypted password and and escape the room. Are they safe or more dangers wait ahead?

### Scene 1: Search room and find components
### Scene 2: Build and use optical table for BB84 QKD protocol
### Scene 3: Decode password and escape room.
